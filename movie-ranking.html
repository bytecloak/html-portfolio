<h1>The best movies according t me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2><hr />
<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. Love how realistic the  movie is.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Hope personified in a single character.
    <br /> The power of small actions done repeatedly
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone</h3>
<p>Childish, it might sound, but I totally love it.</p>
